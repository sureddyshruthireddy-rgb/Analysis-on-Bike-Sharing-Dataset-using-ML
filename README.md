1)Regression Project

2)Objective:
This project predicts daily bike rentals using the Bike Sharing Dataset (2011â€“2012). It demonstrates an end-to-end ML workflow: preprocessing â†’ EDA â†’ feature engineering â†’ regression models â†’ ensemble methods â†’ ANN â†’ model comparison.

3)dataset:
Source: UCI Bike Sharing Dataset
Features:
Temporal: datetime â†’ year, month, day, hour, weekday, weekend
Weather: season, weather, temp, atemp, humidity, windspeed
Flags: holiday, workingday
Target: count (total rentals = casual + registered)

4)Methodology:
ðŸ”¹ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Demand distribution plots
Time-based demand trends (daily/seasonal)
Correlation heatmaps
Weather and working-day impact on rentals
ðŸ”¹ Preprocessing
Feature extraction from datetime
Log-transform applied on target variable (count)
ðŸ”¹ Modeling
Linear Regression
KNN Regressor
Support Vector Regressor (SVR)
Decision Tree (default & tuned)
Random Forest (default & tuned)
Bagging Regressor (default & tuned)
AdaBoost (default & tuned)
Gradient Boosting (default & tuned)
XGBoost (default & tuned)
Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
ðŸ”¹ Feature Selection & Multicollinearity
Applied Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) to reduce multicollinearity
Retrained selected models after feature reduction
ðŸ”¹ Experimentation
Multiple train-test splits tested: 60:40, 65:35, 70:30, 75:25, 80:20
Compared model stability across splits (ANN trained only on one split)

5) Results:
âœ… Ensemble methods (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost) consistently outperformed linear models
âœ… ANN achieved strong accuracy on the chosen split
âœ… Log-transform improved regression performance
âœ… VIF-based feature reduction simplified models without major performance loss
âœ… Final comparison table & visualization plots summarize all models
